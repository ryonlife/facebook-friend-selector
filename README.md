# Facebook Friend Selector jQuery Plugin

Just what it sounds like: a jQuery plugin, and accompanying CSS, to emulate the Facebook dialogs used to select or tag friends. I made this for a Facebook canvas app I was developing. Refer to the [demo.html](https://github.com/RyOnLife/facebook-friend-selector/blob/master/demo.html) file to see it in action along with commented example code.
